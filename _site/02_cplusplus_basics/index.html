<h2 id="look-alive">Look Alive!</h2>
<p>This chapter introduces you to writing small computer programs using the C++ language. Although I assume very little about your previous knowledge, the literacy you gain from this chapter will directly influence your comprehension in subsequent chapters of the book, as most other topics stand on the shoulders of this one. Furthermore, the lessons herein are cumulative, meaning you can't skip one of the topics or you will get lost. If you get stuck on one of the concepts, please seek help in understanding specifically the part that did not make sense before moving on to the next topic. Following the lessons with this sort of rigor will insure that you will get the most out of OpenFrameworks, but also computers in general.</p>
<h2 id="progress-not-perfection">Progress Not Perfection</h2>
<p>I did most of my drawing and painting in the mid-nineties, a high school AP art student sporting a long black ponytail of hair shaved with a step, round eyeglasses, and never an article of clothing without spill, fling, smattering, or splotch of Liquitex Basics acrylic paint. Bored out of my mind in economics class, playing with my TI-82 graphing calculator, I discovered something that flipped a light bulb on in my heart. Unlike smaller calculators around my house growing up, the TI-82 had a thick instruction manual. Amidst sections in this manual about trig functions and other dry out-of-reach science, something caught my thirsty, young eye: a sexy black-on-white pyramid with smaller upside-down pyramids infinitely nested inside, shown in Figure 1.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 1: TI-82 rendering of the Sierpinski triangle, Courtesy of Texas Instruments" src="img/sierpinski-fractal-ti82.png" title="Figure 1: TI-82 rendering of the Sierpinski triangle, Courtesy of Texas Instruments" /></p>
<p>This fractal, the famous <em>Sierpinski triangle</em>, accompanied about twenty-five computer instructions making up the full SIERPINS program. I looked closer at the code, seeing a few numeric operations – nothing too advanced, and most of it was commanding words, like "do this", or "if something then do another thing". I was able to key in the code from the book into the graphing calculator and run the program. At first, just a blank LCD panel. Slowly a few random pixels switched to black here and there, not really showing any pattern. After a few more seconds, the scene filled in and I could already see faint outlines of triangles. After a good long time, my calculator finally matched the picture in the book. My mind was officially blown. Certain things did not make sense. What sort of miracle of nature caused such a complex form to come from so little instruction? The screen had over six-thousand pixels in it, so why is it that a mere twenty-five instructions was all it took to create this amazing, organism-like artwork? Whose artwork was it? Might I derive a new work from it? Rarely had I ever seen such a magical reward coming from so little work. I had found my new basics. I felt the need to understand the program because (I decided) it was important. I went back into the code and changed some of the numbers, then ran the program again. The screen went blank, then drew a different picture, only this time, skewed to the left, falling out of the viewport. Feeling more courageous, I attempted to change one of the English instructions, and the machine showed an error, failing to run.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2: The human loop of a programmer." src="img/programmer-cycle.png" title="Figure 2: The human loop of a programmer." /></p>
<p>The cycle I just described (write code, run app, re-think program's behavior,  revise code, etc.) as shown in Figure 2, is an infinitely repeating loop that I have had a great pleasure of executing for a couple decades and I still love what I do. Each new cycle never fails to surprise me. As I pursue what it means to create a program, and what it means to create software art, the process of iteratively evolving a list of computer instructions always presents as much logical challenge as it does artistic reward. Very few of those challenges have been impossible to solve, especially with other people available to collaborate and assist, or by splitting my puzzle into smaller puzzles. If you have already written code in another environment like Processing, Javascript, or even HTML with CSS, then this first important lesson might seem too obvious.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 3: Don't get the wrong idea." src="img/profit-not.png" title="Figure 3: Don't get the wrong idea." /></p>
<p>For those just now familiarizing themselves with what it means to write small programs, it is important to understand the iterative nature of the code writing process. The anecdote in Figure 3 shows what this process is <em>not</em>. Rarely would you ever enter some code into the editor just once, and expect to hit compile and see your finished outcome. It is natural, and commonly accepted for programs to start small, have plenty of mistakes (bugs), and evolve slowly toward a goal of desired outcome or behavior. In fact it is so commonplace that to make the former assumption is a downright programmer's mistake. Even in older days when programs were hand-written on paper, the author still needed to eyeball the code obsessively in order to work out the mistakes, and therefore the process was iterative. In learning the C++ language, I will provide tiny code examples that you will be compiling on your machine. The abnormal part is typing the code from the book into the editor, and (provided your fingers did not slip), the program magically runs. I am deliberately removing the troubleshooting experience in order to isolate out the subject matter of the C++ language itself. Later on, we will tackle the black art of <em>debugging</em> as a topic all its own.</p>
<h2 id="compiling-my-first-app">Compiling My First App</h2>
<p>Let us start by making the smallest, most immediate C++ program possible, then use the convenient environment to test small snippits of C++ code throughout this chapter. In order to do that, we must have a <em>compiler</em>, which is a program that translates some code into an actual runnable app, sometimes referred to as the executable file. C++ compilers are mostly free of charge to download, and in a lot of cases, open source. The apps we generate will not automatically show up in places like Apple's App store, Google Play, Steam, Ubuntu Apps Directory, or Pi Store. Instead, they are your personal, private program files and you will be responsible for manually sharing them later on. In the following chapter <em>OF Setup and Project Structure</em>, the compiler will sit on your local computer, able to run offline. For now, we will be impatient and compile some casual C++ on the web using a convenient tool by Sphere Research Labs. Please open your web browser and go to <a href="http://ideone.com">ideone</a>.</p>
<p>You will notice right away that there is an editor already containing some code, but it is set to another language. We will now switch from Java to C++. Down at the bottom left of the editor, press the button that says "Java", as shown in Figure 4.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 4" src="img/where-is-says-java.png" title="Figure 4" /></p>
<p>A menu drops down with a list of programming languages. Please choose C++11, shown in Figure 5.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 5" src="img/choose-c11.png" title="Figure 5" /></p>
<p>Notice that the code in the editor changed, and looks something like figure 6.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 6" src="img/empty-template.png" title="Figure 6" /></p>
<p>This is just an empty code template that does nothing, and creates no errors. The numbers in the left hand gutter indicate the line number of the code. Press the green button labeled <em>Run</em> and you'll see a copy of the code,  "Success" in the comments, the section labeled <em>stdin</em> (standard input) will be empty, and <em>stdout</em> (standard output) will also be empty.</p>
<h3 id="interlude-on-typography">Interlude on Typography</h3>
<p>Computer programming code is generally presented in fixed-width typesetting, because it is a form of ascii-art. The indentation, white space characters, and repetitive patterns are all important to preserve and easily eyeball for comparison. Every coder I know except artist Jeremy Rotsztain uses some manner of monospaced font for their code. Some typeface suggestions are Courier, Andale Mono, Monaco, Profont, Monofur, Proggy, Droid Sans Mono, Deja Vu Sans Mono, Consolas, and Inconsolata. From now on, you will see the font style switch to <code>this style</code> . . .</p>
<p>```C++
or this style ...</p>
<pre><code>
. . . and that just means you are looking at some code.

###Comments

Now please press *Edit* (Figure 7) at the top left of the code editor.

![Figure 7](img/ideone-edit.png &quot;Figure 7&quot;)

You will see a slightly different editing configuration but the same template code will still be editable at the top. We will now edit the code. Find line 5, where it says:

```C++
// your code goes here .
</code></pre>

<p>A line beginning with a double forward slash is called a comment. You may type anything you need to in order to annotate your code in a way you understand. Sometimes a it's useful to “comment out code” by placing two forward-slashes before it, because that deactivates the C++ without deleting it. Comments in C++ can also take up multiple lines, or happen inside of some code on 1 line, but the syntax for beginning and ending comment-mode is different. Everything between the /<em> and the </em>/ becomes a comment:</p>
<p>```C++
/<em> 
this is a multi-line comment. 
still in comment mode.
</em>/</p>
<pre><code>
Please delete the code on line 5 and replace it with the following statement:

```C++
cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello World&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
</code></pre>

<p>This line of code tells the computer to say "Hello World" into an implied text-space known as <em>standard output</em> (aka. <em>stdout</em>). When writing a program, it is safe to expect <em>stdout</em> to exist and that the program can say things in it. Other times, it's just a window pane in your coding tool, only used to troubleshoot.</p>
<p>You may put almost anything between those quotes. The quoted phrase is a called a <em>string</em> of text. More specifically, it is a <em>c-string literal</em>. We will cover more on strings later in this chapter. In the code, the chunk <code>cout &lt;&lt;</code> part means "send the following stuff to stdout in a formatted way." The last chunk <code>&lt;&lt; endl</code> means "add a carriage return (end-of-line) character to the end of the hello world message." Finally, at the very end of this line of code, you see a semicolon (;). In C++, semicolons are like a full-stop or period at the end of the sentence. We must type a semicolon after each statement, and usually this is at the end of the line of code. If you forget to type that semicolon, the compile fails. Semicolons are useful because they allow multiple statements to share one line, or a single statement to occupy several lines, freeing the programmer to be flexible and expressive with ones whitespace. The compiler does not get confused because you help it out and show it where the statement ends.</p>
<p>While you typed, perhaps you noticed the text became multi-colored all by itself. This convenient feature is called <em>syntax-coloring</em> and can subconsciously enhance ones ability to read the code, troubleshoot malformed syntax, and assist in searching. Each tool will have its own syntax coloring system so if you wish to change the colors, please expect that it's not the same thing as a word processor. It will not let me assign the font "TRON.TTF" with a glowing aqua color to <em>just</em> <code>endl</code> (which means end-of-line). Instead, I can choose a special style for a whole category of syntax, and see all parts of my code styled that way as long as it's that type of code. In this case, both <code>cout</code> and <code>endl</code> are considered keywords and so the tool colors them black. If these things show up as different colors elsewhere, please trust that it's the same code as before. The entire code should now look like this:</p>
<p>```C++
include <iostream.h>
using namespace std;</p>
<p>int main(){
    cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World" &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}</p>
<pre><code>
Now press the green &quot;ideone it!&quot; button at the bottom right corner and watch the output console, which is the bottom half of the code editor, just above that green button. You will see orange status messages saying things like “Waiting for compilation”, “Compilation”, and “Running”. Shortly after, the program will itself, execute, its output printed. You should see the new message in Figure 8.

![Figure 8](img/hello-world.png &quot;Figure 8: Hello World appears in output window&quot;)

If you made it this far, then give yourself a great big hug. You just wrote your first line of C++ code, you analyzed it, compiled it, ran it, and saw the output. Please send word of your recent success so that we may heed your triumph. Tweet the following:

**cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello World&quot; &lt;&lt; endl; #ofBook**

##Beyond Hello World

Now that we've gotten our feet wet, let's go back and analyze the other parts of the code. The first line is an include statement:

```C++
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Similar to <em>import</em> in Java and CSS, <code>#include</code> is like telling the compiler to cut and paste some other useful code from a file called <em>iostream.h</em> at that position in the file, so you can depend on its code in your new code. In this case, iostream.h <em>provides</em> <code>cout</code> and <code>endl</code> as tools I can use in my code, just by typing their names. In C++, a filename ending in <strong>.h</strong> is called a header file, and it contains code you would include in an actual C++ implementation file, whose filename would end in <strong>.cpp</strong>. There are many standard headers built into C++ that provide various basic services – in fact too many to mention here. If that wasn't enough, it's also commonplace to add an external library to your project, including its headers. You may also define your own header files as part of the code you write, but the syntax is slightly different:</p>
<p>```C++</p>
<h1 id="include-mycustomincludeh">include "MyCustomInclude.h"</h1>
<pre><code>
In OpenFrameworks, double quotes are used to include header files that are not part of the system installation.

###What's with the # ?

It's a whole story, but worth understanding conceptually. The include statement is not really C++ code, it's part of a completely separate compiler pass called *preprocessor*. It happens before your actual programmatic instructions are dealt with. They are like instructions for the code compiler, as opposed to instructions for the computer to run after the compile. Using a pound/hash symbol before these *preprocessor directives*, one can clearly spot them in the file, and for good reason too. They should be seen as a different language in which your real C++ code is interleaved. There aren't many C++ preprocessor directives - they are mostly concerned with herding other code. Here are some you might see.

`#define`
`#elif`
`#else`
`#endif`
`#error`
`#if`
`#ifdef`
`#include`
`#line`
`#pragma`
`#undef`

Let's do an experiment. In the code editor, please comment out the include directive on line 1, then run the code. To comment out the line of code, insert two adjacent forward-slashes at the beginning of the line.

```C++
//#include &lt;iostream&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The syntax coloring will change to all green, meaning it's now just a comment. Run the code by pressing the big green button at the bottom right, and you'll see something new in the output pane.</p>
<pre><code>prog.cpp: In function ‘int main()’:
prog.cpp:5:2: error: ‘cout’ was not declared in this scope
  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello World&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
  ^
prog.cpp:5:27: error: ‘endl’ was not declared in this scope
  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello World&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
                           ^
</code></pre>

<p>The compiler found an error and did not run the program. Instead, it's showing you  where it got confused in attempt to help you fix it. The first part, <em>prog.cpp</em>: tells you the file that contains the error. In this case, ideone.com saved your code into that default file name. Next, it says <code>In function ‘int main()’</code>: file showing you the specific section of the code that contains the error, in this case, between the {curly brace} of a function called <em>main</em>. (We will talk about functions and curly braces later). On the next line, we see <code>prog.cpp:5:2:</code>. The 5 is how many lines from the top of the file, and 2 is how many characters rightward from the beginning of the line. Next, we see <code>error: ‘cout’ was not declared in this scope</code>. That is a message describing what it believes it wrong in the code. In this case, it's fairly correct. iostream.h is gone, and therefore no <code>cout</code> is provided to us, and so when we try to send "Hello World", the compile fails. On the next couple of lines, you see the line of code containing the fallacious <code>cout</code>, plus an extra little up-caret character on the line beneath it, and that is supposed to be an arrow pointing at a character in the code. In this case, the arrow should be sitting beneath the 'c' in <code>cout</code>. The system is showing you visually which token is at fault. A second error is shown, and this time, the compiler complains that there is no endl. Of course, we know that in order to fix the error, we need to include <iostream.h> so let us do that now. Please un-comment line 1 and re-run the code.</p>
<p>```C++</p>
<h1 id="include-wzxhzdk57">include <iostream></h1>
<pre><code>
When using OpenFrameworks, you have choice of tools and platforms. Each one shows you an error in a different way. Sometimes the editor will open up and highlight the code for you, placing an error talk bubble for more info. Other times, the editor will show nothing, but the compile output will show a raw error formatted similar to the one above. Whilst sometimes useful that we receive several errors from a compile, it can save a lot of grief if you focus on understanding and fixing the very first error that got reported. After fixing the top error, it is likely that all subsequent errors will elegantly disappear, having all been covered by your first fix.

###Namespaces at First Glance

Moving on to line 2, we see:

```C++
using namespace std;
</code></pre>

<p>Let's say I'm in the 3rd grade of elementary school and I hop on a school bus to get there each morning. As I walk slowly down the aisle, different students notice my unsightly leg braces and tell me (in Southern accents) "Seat's taken" or "You can't sit here". Finally, I find a seat on the bus next to Jenny. I just experienced conflict and resolution in <em>Seat Space</em>, finally discovering my unique place on the bus.</p>
<p>Let's say you join a social website and it asks you to choose a username. My name is Joshua Nimoy, username might be JNIMOY. I submit the page and it returns an error, telling me that username is already taken, and I have to choose another, since my father, Joseph Nimoy, registered before I did and he's got JNIMOY. And so I must use my middle initial T, and create a more unique username, JTNIMOY. I just created and resolved a <em>namespace conflict</em>. A namespace is a group of unique names - none are identical. It's possible to have identical names, as long as they are a part of two separate namespaces. Namespaces help programmers avoid stepping on each other's toes by overwriting one another's symbols or hogging the good names. Namespaces also provide a neat and tidy organization system to help us find what we're looking for. In OpenFrameworks, everything starts with <code>of</code> . . . like <code>ofSetBackground</code> and <code>ofGraphics</code>. This is one technique to do namespace separation because it's less likely that any other names created by other programmers would begin with <code>of</code>. The same technique is used by OpenGL. Every name in the OpenGL API (Application Programming Interface) begins with <code>gl</code> like <code>glBlendFunc</code> and <code>glPopMatrix</code>. In C++ however, it is not necessary to have a strictly disciplined character prefix for your names, as the language provides its own namespacing syntax. In line 2, <code>using namespace std;</code> is telling the compiler that this .cpp file is going to use all the names in the <code>std</code> namespace. Spoiler-alert! those two names are <code>cout</code> and <code>endl</code>. Let us now do an experiment and comment out line 2, then run the code. What sort of error do you think the compiler will return?</p>
<p>```C++
/<em> using namespace std; </em>/</p>
<pre><code>
It's a very similar error as before, where it cannot find `cout` or `endl`, but this time, there are suggested alternatives added to the message list.

</code></pre>

<p>prog.cpp:5:2: note: suggested alternative:
In file included from prog.cpp:1:0:
/usr/include/c++/4.8/iostream:61:18: note:   ‘std::cout’
   extern ostream cout;  /// Linked to standard output
                  ^</p>
<pre><code>
The compiler says &quot;Hey, I searched for `cout` and I did find it in one of the namespaces included in the file. Here it is. `std::cout`&quot; and in this case, the compiler is correct. It wants us to be *more explicit* with the way we type `cout`, so we express its namespace `std` (standard) on the left side, connected by a double colon (::). it's sort of like calling myself `Nimoy::Joshua`. Continuing our experiment, edit line 5 so that `cout` and `endl` have explicit namespaces added.

```C++
std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello World&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
</code></pre>

<p>When you run the code, you will see it compiles just fine, and succeeds in printing "Hello World" even the line that says <code>using namespace std;</code> is still commented out. Now imagine you are writing a program to randomly generate lyrics of a song. Obviously, you would be using <code>cout</code> quite a bit. Having to type <code>std::</code> before all your <code>cout</code>s would get really tedious, and one of the reasons a programming language adds these features is to reduce typing. So although line 2 <code>using namespace std;</code> was not necessary, having it in place (along with other <code>using namespace</code> statements) can keep ones C++ code easy to type and read, through implied context.</p>
<p>Say I'm at a Scrabble party in Manhattan, and I am the only Josh. People can just call me Josh when it's my turn to have a go at Scrabble. However, if Josh Noble joins us after dinner, it gets a bit confusing and we start to call the Josh's by first and last name for clarity. In C++, the same is also true. It's alright to have two different <code>cout</code> names, one from the  <code>std</code> namespace, and another from the <code>improved</code> namespace, as long as both are expressed with explicit namespaces; <code>std::cout</code> and <code>improved::cout</code>. In fact, the compiler will complain if you don't.</p>
<h2 id="functions">Functions</h2>
<p>Moving on, let us take a look at line 4:</p>
<p>```C++
int main() {</p>
<pre><code>
This is the first piece of code that has a beginning and an end, such that it &quot;wraps around&quot; another piece of code. But more importantly, a function *represents* the statements enclosed within it. The closing end of this *function* is the closing curly brace on line 7:

```C++
}
</code></pre>

<p>In C++, we enclose groups of code statements inside functions, and each function can be seen as a little program inside the greater program, as in my laughably gross oversimplification in figure 9.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 9: Many Functions" src="img/program-anatomy.png" title="Figure 9. A program contains many functions, and each function contains zero or more statements." /></p>
<p>Each of these functions has a name by which we can call it. To call a function is to execute the code statements contained inside that function. The basic convenience in doing this is less typing, and we will talk about the other advantages later. Like a board game, a program has a starting position. More precisely, the program has an <em>entrypoint</em> expected by the compiler to be there. That entrypoint is a function called <em>main</em>. The code you write inside the <em>main</em> function is the first code that executes in your program, and therefore it is responsible for calling any other functions in your program. Who calls your <em>main</em> function? The operating system does! Let's break down the syntax of the main function in this demo. Again, for all you Processing coders, this is old news.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 10: The Function" src="img/function-anatomy.png" /></p>
<p>When defining a function, the first token is the advertised return type. Functions can optionally return a value, like an answer to a question, a solution to a problem, the result of a task, or the product of a process. In this case, <em>main</em> promises to return an <code>int</code>, or <em>integer</em> type, which is a whole number with no fraction or decimal component. Next token is the name of our function. The system expects the word "main" in all lower-case, but you will later define your own functions and we will get into naming. Next is an opening and closing parenthesis. Yes, it seems kind of strange to have it there, since there is nothing inside it. Later, we will see what goes in there - but never leave out the pair of parentheses with functions because in a certain way, that is the major hint to the human that it's a function. In fact, from now on, when I refer to a function by name, I'll suffix it with a ( ), for example <code>main()</code>.</p>
<p>Next, we see an opening curley bracket. Sometimes this opening curley bracket is on the same line as the preceding closing parenthesis, and other times, you will see it on its own new line. It depends on the personal style of the coder and both are fine. Inbetween this opening curley bracket and the closing one, we place our code statements that actually tell the computer to go do something. In this example, I only have one statement, and that is the required <code>return</code>. If you leave this out for a function whose return type is <code>int</code> then the compiler will complain that you broke your promise to return an int. In this case, the operating system interprets a 0 as "nothing went wrong". Just for fun, see what happens when you change the 0 to a 1, and run the code.</p>
<h2 id="custom-functions">Custom Functions</h2>
<p>We will now define our own function and make use of it as a word template. Type the sample code into your editor and run it.</p>
<p>```C++</p>
<h1 id="include-wzxhzdk58">include <iostream></h1>
<p>using namespace std;</p>
<p>void greet(string person){
    cout &lt;&lt; "Good night " &lt;&lt; person &lt;&lt; "." &lt;&lt; endl;
}</p>
<p>int main() {
    greet("moon");

In this new code, notice the second function `greet()` which looks the same but different from `main()`. It has the same curley brackets to hold the code block, but the return type is different. It has the same pair of parentheses, but this time there is something inside. And what about that required return statement? The *void* keyword is used in place of a return type when a function does not return anything. So, since `greet()` has a *void* return type, the compiler will not complain should you leave out the `return`. However, you may still use the return statement to end the execution of the function early. More on this when we get to functions that have multiple lines of code. In the parentheses, you see `string person`. This is an *argument*, an input-value for the function to use. In this case, it's a bit like find-and-replace. Down in `main()`, you see I call `greet()` five times, and each time, I put a different string in quotes between the parentheses. These five lines of code are all ***function calls***. They are telling `greet()` to execute, and passing it the one string argument so it can do its job. That one string argument is made available to `greet()`'s inner code via the argument called `person`. To see the order of how things happen, take a look at Figure 11.

![Figure 11. Function Call Flow](img/function-call.png &quot;Figure 11. Function Call Flow&quot;)

The colorful line in Figure 11 is the path drawn by an imaginary playback head that steps over the code as it executes. We start at the blue part and go in through the main entrypoint, then encounter `greet()`, which is where a *jump* happens. As the line turns green, it escapes out of `main()` temporarily so it can go follow along `greet()` for a while. About where the line turns yellow, you see it finished executing the containing code inside `greet()` and does a second jump (the return) this time going back to the previous saved place, where it continues to the next statement. The most obvious advantage we can see in this example is the reduction of complexity from that long `cout` statement to a simple call to `greet()`. If we must call `greet()` five times, having the routine *encapsulated* into a function gives it convenience power. Let's say you wanted to change the greeting from &quot;Good night&quot; to &quot;Show's over &quot;. Rather than updating all the lines of code you cut-and-pasted, you could just edit the one function, and all the uses of the function would change their behavior along with it, in a synchronized way. Furthermore, code can grow to be pretty complex. It helps to break it down into small routines, and use those routines as your own custom building blocks when thinking about how to build the greater software. By using functions, you are liberated from the need to meticulously represent every detail of your system, and therefore a function is one kind of *abstraction* just like abstraction in art. This sort of abstraction is called *encapsulation of complexity* because it's like taking the big complex thing and putting it inside a nice little capsule, making that big complex thing seem smaller and simpler. It's a very powerful idea - not just in code, but in the growth of civilization, and even in the evolution of life on Earth.

##Encapsulation of Complexity

Imagine actor Laurence Fishburne wearing tinted Pince Nez glasses, offering you two options that are pretty complicated to explain. On the one hand, he is willing to help you escape from the evil Matrix so that you may fulfill your destiny as the hacker hero but it involves living life on life's terms and that is potentially painful but whatever, the story must go on and btw, there is a pretty girl. On the other hand, he is also willing to let you forget this all happened, and mysteriously plant you back in your tiny apartment where you can go on living a lie, none the wiser. These two options are explained in the movie *The Matrix* and then the main character is offered the choice in the form of colored pills, as a way to simplify an otherwise wordy film scenario. The two complex choices are encapsulated into a simple analogy that is much easier for movie audiences to swallow. See Figure 12.

![Figure 12. Red Pill and Blue Pill from The Matrix](img/red-blue-pills.png &quot;Figure 12. Red Pill and Blue Pill from The Matrix&quot;)

Rather than repeating back the entire complicated situation, Neo (the main character) needed only to swallow one of the pills. Even if it were real medicine, the idea of encapsulating complexity still applies. Most of us do not have the expertise to practice medicine in the most effective way, and so we trust physicians and pharmacologists to create just the right blend of just the right herbs and chemicals. When you swallow a pill, it is like calling that function because you have the advantage of not needing to understand the depths of the pill. You simply trust that the pill will cause an outcome. The same is true with code. Most of the time, a function was written by someone else and if that person is a good developer, you are free to remain blissfully ignorant of their function's inner workings as long as you grasp how to properly call their function. In this way, you are the *higher level* coder, meaning that you simply call the function but you did not write it. Someone who creates a project in OpenFrameworks is sitting on the shoulders of the OpenFrameworks layer. OpenFrameworks sits on the shoulders of the OpenGL Utility Toolkit, which sits on OpenGL itself, and so on. In other words, an OpenFrameworks project is a *higher level* application of C++, a language with a reputation for *lower level* programming. As illustrated in Figure 13, I sometimes run into a problem when I tell people I wrote an interactive piece in C++.

![Figure 13. Standing on Shoulders of Giants](img/shoulders-of-giants.png &quot;Figure 13. Standing on Shoulders of Giants&quot;)

There are a few advantages to using C++ over the other options (mostly scripting) for your new media project. The discussion can get quite religious (read: heated) among those who know the details. If you seek to learn C++, then usually it is because you seek faster runtime performance, because C++ has more libraries that you can snap in to your project, or because your mentor is working in that language. An OF project is considered higher level because it is working with a greater encapsulation of complexity, and that is something to be proud of.

## A Brief History

There are many programming languages, each one with its own unique story. Like human languages, they relate in a tangled family tree that eventually leads all the way back to the first computer language by Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace in the 17th century. Languages improve on previous ones for various reasons, such as increasing efficiency/performance, reducing engineering complexity, adding useful features for the programmer, creating new divisions of labor, and in general, making programmers happier. C++, its parent language C, and grandparent language B (BCPL) all come from Bell Laboratories, In fact, the B stands for Bell. Figure 14 shows a picture of Dennis M. Ritchie and Ken Thompson, the creators of C, sitting in front of a PDP-11, the first computer to run Unix. Because C is the next language after B, it uses the next letter in the Roman alphabet.

![Figure 14. Ken Thompson(sitting) and Dennis Richie (standing) in front of a PDP-11, circa 1972](img/kd14.jpg &quot;Figure 14. Ken Thompson(sitting) and Dennis Richie (standing) in front of a PDP-11, circa 1972&quot;)

If I ask my father nicely, he will tell stories about his days at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey in the late 1960s doing liquid crystal research. Some of his colleagues who did heavier computation work could be seen walking around with shoe boxes filled with punch cards. These punch cards (Figure 15) were difficult to create, share, and maintain (imagine dropping that shoe box). Taking turns running jobs on the GE 600-series mainframes also stifled collaboration because the punch card systems were not multi-user. Perhaps it was a bit like waiting to use the largest CNC machine at TechShop.

![Figure 15. Bell Labs punch card from the mid-1960s, courtesy of Lucent](img/bell1.gif &quot;Figure 15. Bell Labs punch card from the mid-1960s, courtesy of Lucent&quot;)

Thompson and Ritchie initiated the development of the Unix operating system in effort to improve these original problems (and provide a useful jig with which they could create their game &quot;Space Travel&quot;). Part of what made Unix attractive was that its heart was written in C, instead of the lower level assembly language - and that made it more portable. Back then, every new machine invented needed to have an assembly language specific to it - that was always the first job of its users. Because Thompson and Ritche ported Unix over to C, it made Unix very portable - giving it a very good chance to spread virally. The birth of the C language happened along-side the birth of Unix. Hence, the present-day ubiquity of Unix-like OSes may explain the importance of C and its derivative languages.

A decade later, Bjarne Stroustrup created a new strain of the C language in order to update it with a new paradigm called *object oriented programming* which introduces an intermediary container between the function and its program called a *class*. The class system allows a program to do special skateboard tricks that you can read about in the ***OOPS!*** chapter. Since C++ is close enough to C, compiling compatibly with it (if you know what you're doing), C++ rides the popularity of C and Unix. C++ gets its name because putting `++` after something in C means adding 1 to it (or *incrementing* it). C++ is the C language, plus one paradigm. C++ is considered by many to be the most popular programming language of all time.

### Derivative Languages

(My apologies to *The Nails*)

Since establishing the C++ standard, there have been a variety of direct derivative languages - some with the C letter in their name, and some without. *Objective-C* is a decade newer than C++. Intermingled with the NeXT operating system (Figure 16 shows a logo by Paul Rand) and the OpenStep project, Objective-C is most popularly used to develop apps for OS X and iOS. *Java* (20 years newer than C++) is considered a direct derivative of C++. It attempts to remove the &quot;C&quot; and keep only the &quot;++&quot;. If you study computer science in university, this language may be one of the first things they teach you, whereas historically, that first language used to be C and C++. *C#* (pronounced C-Sharp) is Microsoft's Java alternative. Originally intended for use in developing .NET apps, you may also use it when developing in Unity - or any platform that uses the Mono project. *C++11* is a newer, more recent version of C++ from 2011 that adds a variety of new features. You may learn more about how it differs from classic C++ in Chapter 15. Finally, *D* is the programming language that takes the next letter in the alphabet after C, also attempting to modernize the language similarly as its contemporaries, and (trivially) did not come from Murray Hill, New Jersey. These different languages are easy to pick up once you grok C++. There are shortcut tutorials to help the C++ programmer understand the other languages and their environments. If you wish to create your own strain of the C++ language, I suggest taking a course on *compiler construction* - for example, the one offered on Coursera by Stanford University's Professor Alex Aiken.

![Figure 16. NeXT Logo by Paul Rand](img/next-logo-paul-rand.jpg &quot;Figure 16. NeXT Logo by Paul Rand&quot;)

Although OS X promotes Objective-C and Windows promotes C#, both XCode and Visual Studio will still compile C and C++ along side Linux because the C and C++ language compilers are in higher demand than their proprietary strains. It can be useful to combine code files written in these various languages in order to create a flexible solution that reduces the amount of re-invention you must do. Fundamentally, OpenFrameworks bases its cross-platform portability on the portability of the C++ language. Theoretically, you should be able to write your OpenFrameworks app once, on one platform, then see it compile and run identically in other environments. 

### Conversational Slang

Sometimes I say C, and sometimes I say C++. Since they are closely related, perhaps you can understand how they are almost synonymous. I also leave out the ++ because I am talking about both languages! C++ is almost a superset of C (see figure 17), so when I talk about the properties of C, I am usually also talking about the properties of C++. To make things worse, the greater slang of C applies to all the C-something languages. Let's say you are a famous code artist presenting at the EyeO festival and a member of the audience asks you to talk about the programming of your piece. You may have used a combination of C++, C, and Objective-C on Mac OS X to make your OpenFrameworks project happen (not to mention Java and C# on your Linode server), but because simplicity is elegant, and because you only have 2 minutes left before they kick you off stage, your answer is shortened - and you say &quot;I wrote it in C&quot;. Perhaps later when that audience member buys you a drink, you can be more specific about all the strains of C-language you actually used. Like most slang, relaxed conversational use of &quot;C&quot; is also context-sensitive. Sometimes preemptively simplifying speech like that is inappropriate when you are speaking to known engineers, developers, and hackers. In that case, saying C when you mean C++ might be construed as fronting!

## Variables (part 1)

&gt; A “thing” is a “think”, a unit of thought
&gt; 
&gt; -- Alan Watts

Please enter the following program into ideone and run it.

```C++
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main(){
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;My friend is &quot; &lt;&lt; 42 &lt;&lt; &quot; years old.&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;The answer to the life the universe and everything is &quot; &lt;&lt; 42 &lt;&lt; &quot;.&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;That number plus 1 is &quot; &lt;&lt; (42+1) &lt;&lt; &quot;.&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The output looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>My friend is 42 years old.
The answer to the life the universe and everything is 42.
That number plus 1 is 43.
</code></pre>

<p>We understand from a previous lesson that stuff you put between the <code>&lt;&lt;</code> operators will get formatted into the <code>cout</code> object, and magically end up in the output console. Notice in the last line, I put a bit of light arithmetic (42+1) in-between parentheses, and it evaluated to 43. That is called an <em>expression</em>, in the mathematics sense. These three lines of code all say something about the number 42, and so they all contain a literal integer. If I want to change that number, I can do what I know from word processing, and "find-and-replace" the 42 to a new value. Now what if I had 100,000 particles in a 3d world. Some have 42's that need changing, but other 42's that should not be changed? Things can get both heavy and complex when you write code. The most obvious application of <em>variables</em> is that they are a very powerful find-and-replace mechanism, but you'll see that variables are useful for more than that. So let's declare an integer at the top of the code and use it in place of the literal 42's.</p>
<p>```C++</p>
<h1 id="include-wzxhzdk59">include <iostream></h1>
<p>using namespace std;</p>
<p>int main(){</p>
<pre><code>int answer = 42;

cout &lt;&lt; "My friend is " &lt;&lt; answer &lt;&lt; " years old." &lt;&lt; endl;
cout &lt;&lt; "The answer to the life the universe and everything is " &lt;&lt; answer &lt;&lt; "." &lt;&lt; endl;
cout &lt;&lt; "That number plus 1 is " &lt;&lt; (answer+1) &lt;&lt; "." &lt;&lt; endl;
return 0;
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<pre><code>
Now that I am using the variable `answer`, I only need to change that one number in my code, and it will show up in all three sentences as 42. That can be more elegant than find-and-replace. Figure 18 shows the syntax explanation for declaring and initializing a variable on the same line.

![Figure 18. Variable declaration and initialization](img/variable-declaration.png &quot;Figure 18. Variable declaration and initialization&quot;)

It is also possible to declare a variable and initialize it on two separate lines. That would look like:

```C++
int answer;
answer = 42;
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, there is a moment after you declare that variable when its answer may be unpredictable and glitchy because in C (unlike Java), fresh variables are not set to zero for free - you need to do it. Instead, the variable is occupied with what ever old computer memory happens to be sitting there at the time. So, unless you intend to make glitch art, please always initialize your variable to some number upon declaring it, even if that number is zero.</p>
<h3 id="naming-your-variable">Naming your variable</h3>
<p>Notice the arrow below saying "must be a valid name". We invent new names to give our namespaces, functions, variables, and other constructs we define in code (classes, structs, enums, and other things I haven't taught you). The rules for defining a new identifier in code are strict in a similar way that choosing a password on a website might be.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your identifier must contain only letters, numbers, and underscores.</li>
<li>it cannot begin with a number, but it can certainly begin with an underscore.</li>
<li>The name cannot be the same as one of the language keywords (for example, the word <code>void</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The following identifiers are okay.</p>
<pre><code>a
A
counter1
_x_axis
perlin_noise_frequency
_         // a single underscore is fine
___       // several underscores are fine
</code></pre>

<p>Notice lowercase a is a different identifier than uppercase A. Identifiers in C++ are case-sensitive.
The following identifiers are not okay.</p>
<p>```C++
1infiniteloop         // should not start with a number
transient-mark-mode   // dashes should be underscores
@jtnimoy              // should not contain an @
the locH of sprite 1  // should not contain spaces
void                  // should not be a reserved word
int                   // should not be a reserved word</p>
<pre><code>
naming your variable `void_int`, although confusing, would not cause any compiler errors because the underscore joins the two keywords into a new identifier. Occasionally, you will find yourself running into `unqualified id` errors. Here is a list of C++ reserved keywords to avoid when naming variables. C++ needs them so that it can provide a complete programming language.

### Naming conventions

&gt; Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open.
&gt;
&gt; **--Albus Dumbledore**

Identifiers (variables included) are written with different styles to indicate their various properties, such as type of construct (variable, function, or class?), data type (integer or string?), scope (global or local?), level of privacy, etc. You may see some identifiers capitalized at the beginning and using `CamelCase`, whilst others remain all `lower_case_using_underscores_to_separate_the_words`. Global constants are found to be named with `ALL_CAPS_AND_UNDERSCORES`. Another way of doing lower-case naming is to start with a lowercase `letterThenCamelCaseFromThere`. You may also see a hybrid, like `ClassName__functionName__variable_name`. These different styles can indicate different categories of identifiers.

More obsessively, programmers may sometimes use what is affectionately nicknamed *Hungarian Notation* adding character badges to an identifier to say things about it but also reduce the legibility, for example `dwLightYears` and `szLastName`. Naming conventions are not set in stone, and certainly not enforced by the compiler. Collaborators generally need to agree on these subtle naming conventions so that they don't confuse one another, and it takes discipline on everyone's part to remain consistent with whatever convention was decided. The subject of naming convention in code is still a comically heated debate amongst developers, just like deciding which line to put the curly brace, and whether to use tabs to indent. Like a lot of things in programming, someone will always tell you you're doing it wrong. That doesn't necessarily mean you are doing it wrong.

### Variables change

We call them variables because their values *vary* during runtime. They are most useful as a bucket where we put something (let's say water) for safe keeping. As that usually goes, we end up going back to the bucket and using some of the water, or mixing a chemical into the water, or topping up the bucket with more water, etc. A variable is like an empty bucket where you can put your stuff. Figure 19 shows a bucket from the game *Minecraft*.

![Figure 19. Bucket, courtesy of Mojang AB](img/minecraft-bucket.png &quot;Figure 19. Bucket, courtesy of Mojang AB&quot;)

If a computer program is like a little brain, then a variable is like a basic unit of remembrance. Jotting down a small note in my sketchbook is like storing a value into a variable for later use. Let's see an example of a variable changing its value.

```C++
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int counter = 0;
    cout &lt;&lt; counter;
    counter = 1;
    cout &lt;&lt; counter;
    counter = 2;
    cout &lt;&lt; counter;
    counter = 3;
    cout &lt;&lt; counter;
    counter = 4;
    cout &lt;&lt; counter;
    counter = 5;
    cout &lt;&lt; counter;
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The output should be <code>012345</code>. Notice the use of the equals sign. It is different than what we are accustomed to from arithmetic. In the traditional context, a single equal sign means the expressions on both sides would evaluate to the same value. In C, that is actually a double equal (==) and we will talk about it later. A single equal sign means "Solve the expression on the right side and store the answer into the variable named on the left side". It takes some getting used to if you haven't programmed before. If I were a beginning coder (as my inner child is perpetually), I would perhaps enjoy some alternative syntax to command the computer to store a value into a variable. Something along the lines of: <code>3 =&gt; counter</code> as found in the language <em>ChucK</em> by Princeton sound lab, or perhaps something a bit more visual, as my repurposing of the Minecraft crafting table in figure 20.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 20. Minecraft crafting table repurposed for variable assignment" src="img/minechuck.png" title="Figure 20. Minecraft crafting table repurposed for variable assignment" /></p>
<p>Historically, C uses the = character that different way because it solves an otherwise verbose (and non-portable) assembly routine for storing a value into a variable.</p>
<pre><code class="asm">mov ax, 4        ; store literal integer into working register
mov bucket, ax  ; move contents of working register into RAM at address 'bucket'
</code></pre>

<p>In the above assembly code, the programmer needs to put the value into an intermediary called a <em>register</em> before it can go into the place in memory we know as a variable. The usefulness of having the variable name on the left side rather than the right becomes apparent in practice since the expressions get get quite lengthy! Beginning a line with <code>varname =</code> ends up being easier for the eyeball to scan because it's guaranteed to be 2 symbols long before starting in on whatever madness you plan on typing after the equals sign.</p>
<p>Analyzing the previous code example, we see the number increments by 1 each time before it is output. I am repeatedly storing literal integers into the variable. Since a programming language knows basic arithmetic, let us now try the following modification:</p>
<p>```C++</p>
<h1 id="include-wzxhzdk60">include <iostream></h1>
<p>using namespace std;</p>
<p>int main(){
    int counter = 0;
    cout &lt;&lt; counter;
    counter = counter + 1;
    cout &lt;&lt; counter;
    counter = counter + 1;
    cout &lt;&lt; counter;
    counter = counter + 1;
    cout &lt;&lt; counter;
    counter = counter + 1;
    cout &lt;&lt; counter;
    counter = counter + 1;
    cout &lt;&lt; counter;
    return 0;
}</p>
<pre><code>
The output should still be `012345`. By saying `counter = counter + 1`, I am incrementing `counter` by 1. More specifically, I am using `counter` in the right-hand &quot;addition&quot; expression, and the result of that (one moment later) gets stored into `counter`. This seems a bit funny because it talks about `counter` during two different times. It reminds me of the movie series, *Back to the Future* in which Marty McFly runs into past and future versions of himself. See Figure 21.

![Figure 21. The future Marty uses the past Marty](img/futuremarty.png &quot;Figure 21. The future Marty uses the past Marty&quot;)

Great Scott, that could make someone dizzy! But after doing it a few times, you'll see it doesn't get much more complicated than what you see there. This is a highly *practical* use of science fiction, and you probably aren't attempting to challenge the fabric of spacetime (unless you are Kyle McDonald, or maybe a Haskell coder). The point here is to modify the contents of computer memory, so we have `counter` from one instruction ago, in the same way that there might already be water in our bucket when we go to add water to it. Figure 22 shows `bucket = bucket + water`.

![Figure 22. bucket = bucket + water](img/minecraft-inc.png &quot;Figure 22. bucket = bucket + water&quot;)

Incrementing by one, or adding some value to a variable is in fact so commonplace in all programming that there is even syntactic sugar for it. *Syntactic Sugar* is a redundant grammar added to a programming language for reasons of convenience. It helps reduce typing, can increase comprehension or expressiveness, and (like sugar) makes the programmer happier. The following statements all add 1 to `counter`.

```C++
counter = counter + 1; // original form
counter += 1;          // &quot;increment self by&quot; useful because it's less typing.
counter++;             // &quot;add 1 to self&quot; useful because you don't need to type a 1.
++counter;             // same as above, but with a subtle difference.
</code></pre>

<p>Let's test this in the program.</p>
<p>```C++</p>
<h1 id="include-wzxhzdk61">include <iostream></h1>
<p>using namespace std;</p>
<p>int main(){
    int counter = 0;
    cout &lt;&lt; counter;
    counter++;
    cout &lt;&lt; counter;
    counter++;
    cout &lt;&lt; counter;
    counter++;
    cout &lt;&lt; counter;
    counter++;
    cout &lt;&lt; counter;
    counter++;
    cout &lt;&lt; counter;
    return 0;
}</p>
<pre><code>
Yes, it's a lot less typing, and there are many ways to make it more concise. Here is one way.

```C++
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int counter = 0;
    cout &lt;&lt; counter++;
    cout &lt;&lt; counter++;
    cout &lt;&lt; counter++;
    cout &lt;&lt; counter++;
    cout &lt;&lt; counter++;
    cout &lt;&lt; counter++;
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The answer is still <code>012345</code>. The postfix incrementing operator will increment the variable even while it sits inside an expression. Now let's try the prefix version.</p>
<p>```C++</p>
<h1 id="include-wzxhzdk62">include <iostream></h1>
<p>using namespace std;</p>
<p>int main(){
    int counter = 0;
    cout &lt;&lt; ++counter;
    cout &lt;&lt; ++counter;
    cout &lt;&lt; ++counter;
    cout &lt;&lt; ++counter;
    cout &lt;&lt; ++counter;
    cout &lt;&lt; ++counter;
    return 0;
}</p>
<pre><code>
If you got the answer `123456`, that is no mistake! The prefix incrementing operator is different from its postfix sister in this very way. With `counter` initialized as 0, `++counter` would evaluate to 1, whilst `counter++` would still evaluate to 0 (but an incremented version of `counter` would be left over for later use). The output for the following example is `1112`.

```C++
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int counter = 0;
    cout &lt;&lt; ++counter; // 1: increments before evaluating
    cout &lt;&lt; counter;   // 1: has NOT changed.
    cout &lt;&lt; counter++; // 1: increments after evaluating
    cout &lt;&lt; counter;   // 2: evidence of change.
    return 0;
}

<p>For arithmetic completeness, I should mention that the subtractive <em>decrementing</em> operator (counter--) also exists. Also, as you might have guessed by now, if one can say <code>counter + 1</code>, then a C compiler would also recognize the other classic arithmetic like <code>counter - 3</code> (subtraction), <code>counter * 2</code> (asterisk is multiplication), <code>counter / 2</code> (division), and overriding the order of operations by using parentheses, such as <code>(counter + 1) / 2</code> evaluating to a different result than <code>counter + 1 / 2</code>. Putting a negative sign before a variable will also do the right thing and negate it, as if it were being subtracted from zero. C extends this basic palette of maths operators with boolean logic and bitwise manipulation; I will introduce them in Variables part 2.</p>
<p>There are a few more essentials to learn about variables, but we're going to take what we've learned so far and run with it in the name of fun. In the meantime, give yourself another pat on the back for making it this far! You learned what variables are, and how to perform basic arithmetic on them.

<p>Imagine riding your bicycle in the streets of your city. When you encounter intersections or forks in the road, you must decide whether to turn, go straight, or turn around based on where you are going, your urgency in getting home, and other places you may want to stop at. The next day, you may take the same route but end up taking very different streets based on the domino effect of your decisions.</p>
<p>Your ability to judge a situation and change your behavior based on your analysis is a kind of prediction behavior that defines intelligence. A computer program can also stop, analyze, and decide how to act in a more simplified way. <em>Conditionals</em> or <em>branching</em> in code are what provides this kind of simple yet useful intelligence. With just a little bit if <em>If-Then-Else</em> in your code, you can automate very complex decision making.</p>

<p>In beginning to understand how code branches, let's imagine the code is a shopping list (code I run on myself). I've been sent to the supermarket by my grandma Ceil to pick up ingredients for <em>Kreplach</em>, the (Ashkenazi) Jewish wonton. We have family visiting from Closter, NJ and since they had the chutzpah to schlep all the way to Brighton Beach, we're going to give them the works - kugel, brisket, and even tzibele kichel to nosh while she finishes cooking (instead of the stale hamantaschen from last Purim). But the only job I have is buying the ingredients for Kreplach. Here is the shopping list:</p>
<pre><code>flour
kosher salt
dozen giant brown organic eggs
1 bottle corn oil
4 sweet onions
ground beef
parsley
pepper
garlic
potatoes
scallions
carrots
</code></pre>

<p>An experienced shopper knows that products and preferred brands are not always in stock, and so we notate the shopping list with alternative purchases in case the primary preference is not available.</p>
<pre><code>Heckers unbleached all purpose flour (pillsbury or gold medal would be fine)
Morton Kosher Salt
dozen giant brown organic eggs (white eggs ok too)
1 bottle Mazola corn oil
4 sweet onions (white onions would be acceptable)
ground beef (ground chicken also ok, but NO traif!)
parsley
pepper
garlic
potatoes (red rose, white rose, yukon gold) NOT Idaho or Russet, not too much shmutz
scallions (chives will do but call me)
carrots
</code></pre>

<p>Although the above is more realistically how one would express conditionals in a shopping list (placing them after the primary product topic), let us refactor the shopping list to C-style conditionals by using indentation, and by "wrapping" code inside some if-braces.</p>
<pre><code>if ( they have Heckers unbleached all purpose flour ){
    get that;
}else if( they only have Heckers BLEACHED flour){
    i'll settle for that over the other brands;
}else{
    get the pillsbury or gold metal brands;
}

get Morton Kosher Salt;

if ( there are giant brown organic eggs ){
    get a dozen of those;
}else{
    get a dozen of whatever eggs;
}

get 1 bottle Mazola corn oil;

if ( there are sweet onions ){
    get 4 of those;
}
//otherwise do nothing, I have white onions in the apartment.

if(the butcher has chop meat AND that meat is not traif AND (it is chicken or it is beef) ){
    get 2 lb of it;
}else{
    Boychik, call me and i'll direct you another kosher butcher in our hood;
}

get parsley;
get pepper;
get garlic;

if(they have red rose, white rose, or yukon potatoes and they don't have a lot of shmutz){
    get 8 of them;
}

if(they don't have scallions){
    get chives;
}else{
    get scallions;
}

get carrots;

</code></pre>

<p>Perhaps you noticed a pattern in the above <em>pseudo-code</em>, where I define a bracing structure that looks similar to a function in that it has parentheses and curly braces. Those are if-then-else statements, and they are a type of <em>flow control</em>. Figure 24 explains the parts.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 24. Anatomy of a conditional" src="img/conditional-anatomy.png" title="Figure 24. Anatomy of a conditional" /></p>
<p>The part labelled <code>test</code> is a <em>boolean logic</em> expression, and that means it ultimately results in a TRUE or FALSE answer. Let us look at some real code to see how a true or false test looks in context.</p>
<p>```C++</p>
<h1 id="include-wzxhzdk63">include <math.h></h1>
<h1 id="include-wzxhzdk64">include <iostream></h1>
<p>using namespace std;</p>
<p>int main(){
    int counter = 0;</p>
<pre><code>counter++;
cout &lt;&lt; counter;
if(counter &gt; 1){
    cout &lt;&lt; " is greater than 1";
}
cout &lt;&lt; endl;

counter++;
cout &lt;&lt; counter;
if(counter &gt; 1){
    cout &lt;&lt; " is greater than 1";
}
cout &lt;&lt; endl;

counter++;
cout &lt;&lt; counter;
if(counter &gt; 1){
    cout &lt;&lt; " is greater than 1";
}
cout &lt;&lt; endl;

return 0;
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<pre><code>
Each time, I am checking to see if `counter` is greater than 1, and if that is the case, then a bit of extra text gets printed to the console. If you run this code (and I highly encourage you to do so), you would see the following output.

</code></pre>

<p>1
2 is greater than 1
3 is greater than 1</p>
<pre><code>
The first time it evaluates `counter &gt; 1`, the result is false, and so the indented code does not execute. There are a couple other pieces of the if-structure worth introducing. One important one is `else`, which opens up a second block of code to execute if the condition is false.

```C++

if(true){
    // this code happens if the condition is true
}else{
    // this code happens if it is false
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is different from simply putting an un-braced line of code beneath the if-clause since that free-roaming line of code would execute <em>whether or not</em> the condition were true. So <code>else</code> turns out to be pretty convenient. Another similar piece is <code>else if</code> that allows you to cascade your if-then clauses in a way similar to CSS.</p>
<p>```C++</p>
<p>if(condition1){
    // this code happens if condition1 is TRUE, then the rest is skipped.
}else if(condition2){
    // this code happens if condition1 was FALSE, however condition2 is TRUE.
}else if(condition3){
    // this code happens if condition2 and condition1 were both FALSE, however condition3 is TRUE.
}else{
    // this code happens if none of the 3 conditions are true
}</p>
<pre><code>
Using `else if`, it's easy to build a flexible filter system for decision making.

### Syntactic Sugar for Conditionals

The following is debated as something worth avoiding by folks like JSLint (who are also strict about whitespace). The reason I introduce it here is because you'll see it in OpenFrameworks related code, and I want you to recognize what you are seeing. If-statements can be expressed more concisely by using the single-line syntax, which is less flexible.

```C++
if (counter &gt; 1) cout &lt;&lt; &quot;yes, it's greater&quot;;
</code></pre>

<p>An if-statement with no curly braces will only "limit" the one immediately following line of code. Even with the other snap-in parts, the same "next line only" rules apply.</p>
<p>```C++
if (counter &gt; 1) cout &lt;&lt; "yes, it's greater";
else if (counter &lt; 10) cout &lt;&lt; "well, it's still smaller than 10";
else cout &lt;&lt; "The counter was outside the 2-10 range.";</p>
<pre><code>
The above code will do the exact same thing as:

```C++
if (counter &gt; 1) {
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;yes, it's greater&quot;;
} else if (counter &lt; 10) {
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;well, it's still smaller than 10&quot;;
} else {
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;The counter was outside the 2-10 range.&quot;;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can even mix and match which parts of the clause are "braced" and which ones are one-liners.
If at all possible, I recommend using the fully braced syntax for all new code in the name of fast eyeball scanning. There is also something called a <em>ternary operator</em> that looks like <code>a &gt; b ? x : y</code>. I'll let you google that on your own if you are genuinely curious, but I should discourage the use of ternary-ifs as well because they are esoteric, not terribly portable, difficult to scale or nest, and can get confusing fast. On the other hand, I do recommend you get to know ternaries in case you run into someone else's.</p>
<h3 id="inequality-operators">Inequality Operators</h3>
<p>So far, I've glossed over that part that goes <code>counter &gt; 1</code>. Perhaps you recall a moment in third grade when the teacher taught you the "pacman" rule of inequality, where greedy pacman wants to go chomp the bigger number, so he faces in that direction. Comparison operators in C are based on that.</p>
<p>```C++
a &gt; b // a is greater than b
a &lt; b // a is less than b
a &gt;= b // a is greater-than-or-equal-to b
a &lt;= b // a is less-than-or-equal-to b
a == b // a is equal to b
a != b // a is not equal to b</p>
<pre><code>You will notice the use of double-equal sign to mean the original thing you thought an equal sign was supposed to be used for. A common mistake for beginning coders is the blending between single and double equal signs. Please take the time to know this difference because it will save you some mind-numbingly mysterious errors in the future.

### Boolean Logic

Inequalities can be joined together with logical operators called AND, OR, and NOT, which do much the same thing they are already doing in natural English. AND is typed out as the `&amp;&amp;` operator, while OR is the `||` operator. NOT is a prefixed exclamation mark, and it inverts the truth state of an expression. Here are some boolean logic expressions.

```C++
true || false             // true
false || false            // false
true || false || false    // true

false &amp;&amp; true             // false
true &amp;&amp; true              // true
false &amp;&amp; false            // false

!true                     // false
!false                    // true

true &amp;&amp; !(true || false)  // false
false || true &amp;&amp; !false   // true
</code></pre>

<p>"Boolean" is named after George Boole, one of the fathers of computer science who worked out this sort of true/false maths. You'll find boolean logic in everything  partly because it powers the if-then clauses. The keywords <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> are considered <em>global constants</em>. Conveniently, any non-zero number qualify as true when placed in a boolean context, whilst all zero values qualify as false. In that way, you might set up your arithmetic to land on a zero or non-zero in formulating a testing expression for your if-then clause. In the following example of a conditional, you'll see boolean logic operators used to join numeric comparison.</p>
<p>```C++
if (counter &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; counter &lt; 20) {
    cout &lt;&lt; "it's within the 10-20 range";
} else if (counter &lt;= 0) {
    cout &lt;&lt; "it's zero or less";
} else {
    cout &lt;&lt; "all other cases";
}</p>
<pre><code>
### Nesting

If-then clauses may also be *nested* meaning you can place an entire if-then clause inside one of the code blocks of another. Of course, the indentation needs to observe proper recursion.

```C++

if( counter &gt; 30 ){

    if(counter &gt; 50){
        // todo: do something
    }

}else{

    if(counter &lt; 0){

        if(counter &lt; -10){
            //todo: do something
        }

    }else{
        //todo: do something else
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>The term <em>nesting</em> is the same concept as the Matryoshka doll, as shown in Figure 25. You can place the hollow Russian dolls inside one another until it appears like there is only one doll. It's trippy because of the concentric modules (recursion) but it is incredibly useful in crafting an algorithm.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 25. Matryoshka nesting doll" src="img/Russian-Matroshka2.jpg" title="Figure 25. Matryoshka nesting doll" /></p>
<h2 id="looping">Looping</h2>
<p>You may have noticed that the recent C++ example code had a lot of cutting and pasting in it. This brute-force way of forging repetitive behavior is not as flexible, and nowhere near as concise as simply telling your code to loop.</p>

<pre><code>
. . . and continues to execute until ideone decides to kill the process (force quit) the program prematurely. Truth be told, if you were running the very same app directly on your laptop as you would be doing in a normal OpenFrameworks situation, the program would run forever - until the computer runs out of resources, reboots, or you kill the process yourself. The reason it keeps incrementing `counter` then prints its value to the console infinitely is because I placed a `true` into the parentheses. Figure 26 explains each part of the simple yet powerful `while` clause.

![Figure 26. While Clause](img/while-anatomy.png &quot;Figure 26. While Clause&quot;)

Normally, you would not want your program to simply loop forever. Let's modify the code so that the loop knows to stop after hitting 100.

```C++
while(counter &lt; 100){
    counter ++;
    cout &lt;&lt; counter &lt;&lt; &quot;, &quot;;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I changed the contents of the <code>while</code>'s conditional expression so that it will only loop up to 100. The output is:</p>
<pre><code>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37,
38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54,
55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71,
72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88,
89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100,

</code></pre>

<p>This is not the only way to stop a while loop. Let us nest some if-then clauses into the while loop, so I can demonstrate the <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> statements.</p>
<p>```C++
    while(true){
        counter ++;
        cout &lt;&lt; counter &lt;&lt; " ";
        if(counter==10){
            break;<br />
        }
    }</p>
<pre><code>
The output is `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 `. As I loop, I am repeatedly checking to see if counter is 10, and if that is the case, I `break` out of the loop. 

### Modulo %

For the next example, I'd like to introduce you to the modulo operator, which is not so common in basic arithmetic but turns out to be useful and fun in programming. It is the percent sign operator, placed between 2 numbers, and it computes the *remainder* from dividing the left number by the right number. Here are a few examples:

+ 4 % 2 is 0 because 4 / 2 ends up being 2 with no remainder.
+ 10 % 3 is 1
+ 10 % 4 is 2
+ 9 % 10 is 9
+ 10 % 10 is 0
+ 11 % 10 is 1

Modulo is great for easily making patterns. The following example prints an alternating pattern of # and space, forever.

```C++
while(true){
    counter ++;
    if(counter % 2 == 0){
        cout &lt;&lt; '#';
    }else{
        cout &lt;&lt; ' ';
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This outputs <code># # # # # #</code>. The next modification prints out <code># ## ## ## ## ##</code>.</p>
<p>```C++
while(true){
    counter ++;
    if(counter % 3 &lt; 2){
        cout &lt;&lt; '#';
    }else{
        cout &lt;&lt; ' ';
    }
}</p>
<pre><code>
Getting back to demonstrating the `continue` statement, I will use the % operator to &quot;skip&quot; only even numbers.

```C++
while(true){
    counter ++;
    if(counter % 2 == 0){
        continue;
    }else{
        cout &lt;&lt; counter &lt;&lt; ' ';
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The output begins with <code>1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 37 39 41 43 45 47</code>, only odd numbers. The <code>continue</code> statement is different from <code>break</code> because it only breaks out of that one instance of the loop and starts directly at the next. <code>break</code> will end the loop entirely.</p>
<p>The following program uses a nested while-loop and an additional counter variable to generate a sawtooth wave pattern in ASCII art.</p>
<p>```C++</p>
<h1 id="include-wzxhzdk67">include <math.h></h1>
<h1 id="include-wzxhzdk68">include <iostream></h1>
<p>using namespace std;</p>
<p>int main(){
    int counter = 0;
    int innerCounter = 0;
    while(true){
        counter ++;</p>
<pre><code>    innerCounter = 0;
    while(innerCounter &lt; (counter % 32) ){
        innerCounter++;
        cout &lt;&lt; 'O';
    }
    cout &lt;&lt; endl;
}

return 0;
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>

## For-Loop

Because a *finite* loop is so common, there is syntactical sugar for it. This sugar is so common in every language that it ceases to be sugar. A for-loop allows you to concisely iterate through a counting range. The loops are considered safer because they prevent the whole &quot;infinity&quot; thing, and on the other hand, there are ways to trick a for-loop into looping infinitely. They are incredibly practical, and you see them everywhere. Figure 27 shows the syntax breakdown of a for-loop that iterates 100 times.

![Figure 27. For-Loop Anatomy](img/for-anatomy.png &quot;Figure 27. For-Loop Anatomy&quot;)

That whole chunk of `for( int i = 0 ; i &lt; 100 ; i++ )` seems confusing at first but you will get to know it pretty fast. it just means &quot;do this 100 times&quot;, and it is worth practicing typing that very thing out a few times so you can commit it into muscle memory. Here are a few for-loops.

```C++

for(int i = 100 ; i &gt;= 0 ; i--){
    //iterates with i from 100 to 0
}

for( int i = 0 ; i &lt; 100 ; i += 2){
    //iterates with i from 0 to 100, skipping 2 each time.
}

for( int i = 0 ; i &lt; 10 ; i++ ){
    for( int j = 0 ; j &lt; 10 ; j++ ){
        for( int k = 0 ; k &lt; 10 ; k++ ){
            // a triple nested for-loop using variables i,j,k
        }
    }
}

</code></pre>

<p>The iterating variable in a for-loop is commonly named <code>i</code>, the inner one is named <code>j</code>, and the one inside that is <code>k</code>. After that, the emerging standard starts to vary but I have seen <code>ii</code>,<code>jj</code>,<code>kk</code>, and then <code>iii</code>,<code>jjj</code>,<code>kkk</code>. programmers also just break down and start using more expressive variable names. In nested for-loops that iterate through pixels, you will commonly see <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and sometimes <code>z</code> as the iterator names. If you see the variable <code>i</code> in someone's code, chances are it's a local variable declared at the top of the for-loop. Just like the while-loop, a for-loop will respond to <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> statements. Here is an example of a double for-loop that generates a 2-dimensional pattern into the console.</p>
<p>```C++</p>
<h1 id="include-wzxhzdk69">include <iostream></h1>
<p>using namespace std;</p>
<p>int main(){
    for( int y = 0; y &lt; 20 ; y++ ){

            if(y%2==0){
                if(x%2==0){

Just for fun, I'm going to introduce a distance function. You don't need to understand the pythagorean theorem (unless you want to) but just paste the useful function into your code so you can measure distance.

```C++
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;
using namespace std;

int distance(int x1,int y1,int x2, int y2){
    int xDelta = x1-x2;
    int yDelta = y1-y2;
    return sqrt(xDelta * xDelta + yDelta * yDelta);
}

int main(){
    for( int y = 0; y &lt; 20 ; y++ ){ 
        for( int x = 0 ; x &lt; 80 ; x++ ){

            if( distance(x,y,40,10) &lt; 6 ){ // if this pixel is inside the hole
                cout &lt;&lt; ' '; // render only spaces.
            }else if(y%2==0){ // otherwise do the usual wave thing.
                if(x%2==0){
                    cout &lt;&lt; ')';
                }else{
                    cout &lt;&lt; ' ';
                }
            }else{

<p>The new if-statement measuring the distance from the circle's center allows us to render the inside of the circle with a different letter. The reason it looks tall and skinny is because in ACSII art, the characters are 2x taller, and we have not accounted for that in the code. We can fix that by multiplying the correct things by 2 in the arguments of <code>distance()</code> call.</p>
<p>```C++
            if( distance(x,y*2,40,20) &lt; 17 ){ // Y and circle-center-Y both multiplied by 2</p>

The output should be more circular, depending on the line-height of the font renderer.

## Returning Early from a Function

When I first introduced functions, we had not learned enough code statements to fill those functions with more than one line of code. Now that you've seen a bit more, I'd like to cover something I had omitted. You have seen how it is possible to `break` out of a loop. it is also possible to break out of an entire function with the special `return` statement, and this will skip the rest of the function and go directly back to the calling code.

```C++
void doSomething(int a){
    if ( a &lt;= 0 ) {
        return;
    } else {
        for(int i=0;i&lt;a;i++){
            cout &lt;&lt; '#';
        }
        cout &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above function has a return type of <code>void</code> and so it is not required to return any value. You can see at the top that I am validating the value of <code>a</code> to make sure it is above zero before I render that many <code>#</code>s into the console. I call the <code>return</code> statement early, and it escapes from the function.</p>
<h2 id="bouncing-ball">Bouncing Ball</h2>

We have a function `drawFrame()` whose job it is to render 1 frame of animation into the console as ASCII art. Above that, we have a couple variables `width` and `height` to store the size of the canvas. Now let's add the ball. To do this, we add a couple more global variables below `width` and `height` to hold the ball's position, and then we add an if-statement to the renderer to make sure it makes a visual exception for the ball position, which is 1 character.

```C++
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int width = 20;
int height = 6;
int ballX = 10;                                   // new
int ballY = 3;                                    // new

void drawFrame(){
    for(int y = 0 ; y &lt; height; y++ ){
        for(int x = 0 ; x &lt; width; x++ ){
            if ( x == ballX &amp;&amp; y == ballY ) {     // new
                cout &lt;&lt; 'O';                      // new
            } else {                              // new
                cout &lt;&lt; '.'; // draw each column
            }

        }
        cout &lt;&lt; endl; // new row
    }
    cout &lt;&lt; endl; // margin-bottom
}

int main(){
    drawFrame();
    return 0;

<p>Let's make the ball move left and right by adding a <code>force</code> global variable just for the x value of the ball, then start adding the force to the ball's position, rendering frame after frame.</p>

As you can see, the ball's position keeps getting 1 added to it, and eventually it falls off the canvas. To make it bounce off the walls, we must add conditions into `updatePhysics()` that detect the ball collision with the wall, and change the direction of its force.

```C++
void updatePhysics(){
    if( (ballX+1) ==width || ballX==0){   // new
        forceX = -forceX;           // new
    }                               // new
    ballX += forceX;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The output will show the ball properly bouncing off the left and right walls.</p>

<p>To make the ball move up and down in addition to left and right, we simply add a <code>forceY</code> and repeat the working algorithm over from the X behavior.</p>
<p>```C++
int forceX = 1;
int forceY = 1;                           // new</p>
<p>void updatePhysics(){
    if( (ballX+1)==width || ballX==0){
        forceX = -forceX;
    }</p>
<pre><code>if( (ballY+1)==height || ballY==0){   // new
    forceY = -forceY;                 // new
}                                     // new

ballX += forceX;
ballY += forceY;                      // new
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<pre><code>
The output will show the ball bouncing diagonally.

If you were able to follow along this far, then give yourself another hug because you just wrote a basic physics simulator and rendered it to the console frame by frame. Let us know you are awesome by tweeting this:

**I made a ball bounce in code #ofBook**

## Next Steps

What you know so far is powerful enough to write a bouncing ball, but we still have more to go. What if we want the ball to travel slower than 1 pixel per frame? We would need to use fractions somehow. What if we want the ball to leave trails? We would need some way of remembering the pixel values. These skills and more are coming up before the end of the chapter. The previous bouncing ball excercise was a way for you to test yourself and see if you understand each part of the language. It was also a way for you to put all those pieces together and see how they work as one. If you found it intimidating or confusing, please go back and try to review the parts of this chapter that cover those topics you are fuzzy about before continuing. On the other hand, if you feel like you have got this and want to practice, then here are some bonus excercises to help you develop your C++ skills.

+ Expand the canvas and render the ball like the below example, adjusting the scene so no part of the ball falls out of frame.
</code></pre>

<p>.......
..._...
../ ..
.._/..
.......</p>
<pre><code>
+ Change the diagonal pattern of the ball so it is not always travelling in 45 degree angles.
+ Try adding a second ball to the scene and render it differently than the first.
+ If the two balls ever collide, print &quot;YOU WIN&quot; and stop the program.
+ Try rendering the balls as larger circles using the `distance()` function from a previous example.

## Variables (part 2)

### Variables have a scope.

You may have noticed something different in the bouncing ball example. There were variables declared outside of the functions. In previous examples, I had declared variables inside the functions. Other variables were declared inside the parentheses of functions as arguments, and inside the for-loop as an iterator. These variables are declared in different *scopes* of the code. We talk about scope by saying a variable is *local* (existing only inside my immediate curly braces) or *global* (existing for the entire program). Intuitively, we can think about global and local variables in the geographic sense of the words &quot;local&quot; and &quot;global.&quot; Let us apply this idea to musical trends.

Something that is local (a local concert by a local band) will happen in a smaller, lesser known location - and will happen by a lesser known (but just as important!) local band. A world traveller may come to see the show but since she goes to so many shows in so many locations, she forgets about our local band. Because she forgets about the local band, it gives the band an opportunity to change their name from &quot;From First to Last&quot; to &quot;Skrillex&quot;, and adopt a fresher musical genre. When our world traveller returns to the same city to see the same local band, it has benefited from a fresh new start. This fresh new start is why we use local variables. Their ability to reset (their values forgotten quickly) is incredibly useful to us. Global variables, on the other hand, are classical musicians like Ludwig van Beethoven or Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, whose names ring far and wide about the Earth (and possibly beyond), never to be forgotten. Their music was appreciated long ago and will continue to be appreciated, in many countries. Their musician names are known globally, and persist (stay the same) globally. This absolute stability of a global variable is what makes them so useful, in contrast to a more local variable. We need both global and local variables to make the whole system work, just like we need both global and local musicians for the health of music!

![Figure 26. Global versus Local, with apologies to Sonny Moore ](img/global-local.png &quot;Figure 26. Global versus Local with apologies to Sonny Moore&quot;)

### Apologies

I know it is hip to hate on Skrillex, so remember that his career has just begun. He has gone from local to global in a small amount of time, which is impressive. I am sure he will transform into an even more globally recognized musician than he already is, and then we will all stop hating on him. On the other hand, people have been hating on Mozart's appearance and character for 256 years (a more globally persisting rejection). Like making music, someone will always tell you you're not a real coder. Do not let that stop you. Having read the book &quot;Coders at Work&quot; in which Peter Seibel interviews the top programmers and computer scientists, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that people came from a diversity of backgrounds, and some saw themselves as architects or writers. Being a good programmer is different from being a good computer scientist or mathematician!

Variables at a more local scope are incredibly impactful and important because they deal with that which is closest to us, a bit like being closer to ones nerves. If we did everything using global variables all the time, we would have collisions - and perhaps remember too much garbage. Code and computer memory would grow tangled like the ratty hair of electronic musician. The idea of a local variable is newer, and was introduced for organization reasons. Programmers have made good efforts to avoid tangled, confusing code - and one way to do it is through keeping variables local.

When dealing with nested clauses in code, global and local are less black and white since the *scope* is more than 2 matryoshka dolls deep. A variable declared at various locations within the curly brace garden can be viewed as &quot;slightly more global&quot; or &quot;much more local&quot;, as in figure 27.

![Figure 27. Locality](img/global-local-circles.png &quot;Figure 27. Locality&quot;)

Let us see how this looks in code.

```C++
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int myGlobal;

void addOne(){
    myGlobal += 1;
}

int main() {
    for(int i=0;i&lt;4;i++){
        cout &lt;&lt; myGlobal &lt;&lt; ' ';
        addOne();
    }
    cout &lt;&lt; endl;

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The output is <code>0 1 2 3</code>. Notice <code>addOne()</code> and <code>main()</code> are <em>sharing</em> the global variable. Its value remains the same between them. Unfortunately, <code>myGlobal</code> is forgotten when the program is finished running, which makes it <em>local</em> within the scope of this program. To make its value even more persistent, we need to write it to a file, database, or share it over the network. That level of global-ness is one you will see explained in later chapters by other authors. Now let's deliberately cause an error.</p>
<p>```C++</p>
<h1 id="include-wzxhzdk72">include <iostream></h1>
<p>using namespace std;</p>
<p>void addOne(){
    cout &lt;&lt; i;
}</p>
<p>int main() {
    for(int i=0;i&lt;4;i++){
        addOne();
    }
    cout &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}</p>
<pre><code>
The output is a compiler error.

</code></pre>

<p>prog.cpp: In function ‘void addOne()’:
prog.cpp:5:10: error: ‘i’ was not declared in this scope
  cout &lt;&lt; i;
          ^</p>
<pre><code>
The compiler has a problem understanding what you mean by `i` within the scope of `addOne()` because `i` is not a global variable (it only exists inside the for-loop of `main()`) and because no local variable `i` has been declared for the personal use of `addOne()`. If we wanted to access the value of `i` from within `addOne()`, the best thing to do would probably be to pass `i`'s value as an argument in the `addOne()` function.

```C++
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

void addOne(int i){
    i *= 2;
    cout &lt;&lt; i;
}

int main() {
    for(int i=0;i&lt;5;i++){
        addOne(i);
    }
    cout &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The output of this code is <code>02468</code>, not <code>026</code> as if <code>int i</code> were shared between the two functions. You see I added an argument/parameter to <code>addOne()</code> called <code>int i</code>. Notice I manipulate the value of <code>i</code> while inside <code>addOne()</code> by multiplying it by 2 before printing it out. Each time <code>addOne()</code> is called, the value of <code>i</code> passed to it is copied over from the <code>int i</code> in the for-loop of <code>main()</code>, as if it forgot that it was multiplied by 2 in <code>addOne()</code>. That is because there are 2 separate <em>local</em> versions of <code>int i</code>. See figure 28.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 28. Two separate local variables named i" src="img/both-named-i.png" title="Figure 28. Two separate local variables named i" /></p>
<p>When I call <code>addOne()</code>, I am only passing the <em>value</em> of the first <code>i</code> so that it gets stored in the more temporary <code>int i</code> argument of <code>addOne()</code>. Figure 29 shows the lifespan of a function's argument, which is a certain type of local variable.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 29. Lifespan of a local" src="img/local-born-die.png" title="Figure 29. Lifespan of a local" /></p>
<p>Just the same, if I were to declare any variables inside the scope of that function, those variables will also be forgotten when the function returns. They only exist inside that scope. In addition to <em>passing by value</em>, there is also such thing as <em>passing by reference</em> in which you are not only sharing the value of the variable, you are also sharing the actual place in computer memory - as if the variable were made global. memory pointers are an advanced topic better covered later, but the syntax looks like <code>void addOne(int&amp; i){</code> with an ampersand specified before the variable name. if you made this slight modification to the above code example, you will see the output becomes <code>026</code>. </p>
<h3 id="fundamental-types">Fundamental Types</h3>
<p>Variables have different <em>types</em>, meaning they hold different kinds of information in them. Some take up more memory than others. Returning to the Minecraft metaphor, we can think about putting more than just water in more than just iron buckets.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 30. Minecraft Vessles" src="img/minecraft-vessles.png" title="Minecraft Vessles" /></p>
<p>In Minecraft, Buckets will hold milk and lava in addition to water. Furthermore, there are a few other kinds of containers meant for other liquids and other stuff. Requiring the correct container for the correctly according data makes C a <em>strictly typed</em> (or <em>strongly typed</em>) language because it is strict about which type of variable you use. Strictly typed variables are arguably a big virtue for a programming language, and are kept in as a matter of choice since they reduce errors, and greatly speed the app's performance. The issue of whether or not to use a strict or loosely typed language for a project is a very important decision to make, but whether or not one should devote ones career exclusively to strict or loose typing is an unhealthy sort of xenophobia. Both walks of life have their pros and cons.</p>
<p>In the beginning of this chapter, we declared strings and since then, we've declared mostly integers with the keyword <code>int</code> just because they were a convenient general purpose data type for immediate gratification, but as I hinted during the bouncing ball exercise, an <code>int</code> has its limitations. Let me introduce a couple new types.</p>
<pre><code>float myNumber = 340.1928; 
char myLetter = 'E';
</code></pre>

<p>Unlike an <code>int</code>, A <code>float</code> allows decimal points, and so you can work at a higher resolution. A <code>char</code> holds a single ASCII character. It only needs to take up 8-bits of memory whilst the <code>float</code> and <code>int</code> take up more (therefore allowing them to express a wider range of values). I will touch briefly on the bits and bytes of memory when we get into bitwise operators, and then Arturo will give you much more in Chapter 16. Let's see the <code>float</code> in action!</p>
<p>```C++</p>
<h1 id="include-wzxhzdk73">include <iostream></h1>
<p>using namespace std;</p>
<p>int main() {
    float myNumber = 0.0;
    for(int i=0;i&lt;100;i++){
        myNumber += 0.012;
        cout &lt;&lt; myNumber &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
    return 0;
}</p>

Floating point values are useful because they allow us get in-between the piano keys of an integer, and that is why I call them the violin of variables. But notice in this list of fractionally incrementing values that a phantom 0.000001 is added for a little while, beginning around 0.840001. Sometimes you will see these minuscule errors when working with floating point numbers. This strange phenomenon is called a *floating point error* and is a fundamental problem with floating point technology at large, sometimes bringing a headache to a designer trying to render the number in a sane looking way. For the purposes of this chapter, I will not point out floating point errors when they arise, but please be comforted in knowing this is a hot topic in computer science, and there are certainly ways of remedying it, later.

Look what happens when we go back to that code example and change the type from `float` to `int`.

```C++
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int myNumber = 0.0;      // changed from float to int!
    for(int i=0;i&lt;100;i++){
        myNumber += 0.012;
        cout &lt;&lt; myNumber &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The output becomes a long, serene list of zeros since the <code>int</code> data type cannot handle a tiny fraction like 0.012. So during the moment it tries to add 0.012 to myNumber (which is an int), 0.012 gets automatically rounded down to an integer, which is zero every time. Now let's try the opposite example, storing ints into a float.</p>
