<h2 id="introduction">introduction</h2>
<p>This chapter will give you an introduction to working with openFrameworks outside of your computer screen and into the physical world.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways of taking your openFrameworks app out of the frame of your own personal computer and getting it to interact with the outside world.  The first method that we’ll look at is interfacing with the excellent <strong>Arduino</strong> prototyping platform.  Arduino is, in its own words, an <em>“open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software… intended for artists, designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments.</em>”  It’s easy to see why there’s a lot of overlap between communities of people interested in using openFrameworks and Arduino!  With Arduino, it’s quick to get your openFrameworks app hooked up to sensors (like light sensors, proximity sensors, or other methods of environmental input), actuators (like lights, motors, and other outputs), and real-time interaction.  You're free to move out of the realm of pixels and into the physical world.</p>
<p>This chapter assumes that you have the Arduino IDE installed, in addition to the environment that you normally use for working with openFrameworks.  If not, you can download it from the Arduino website (arduino.cc) or the Arduino github (github.com/arduino).</p>
<p>Additionally, following along with the examples in this chapter requires you to have a few pieces of basic hardware.  You’ll need an Arduino (any generation; an Uno, Leonardo, or Duemilanove will look the most like the graphics in this chapter but any USB-connected Arduino will work just fine) and the appropriate USB cable to connect to your computer.<br />
</p>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-serial-communication">getting started with serial communication</h2>
<p><strong>SETTING UP YOUR ARDUINO</strong></p>
<p>Connecting to the computer (how in-depth to go here?)</p>
<p><strong>SERIAL: ONE AFTER THE OTHER</strong></p>
<p>Serial, in the most basic language sense, refers to things that come one after another; it’s a term often used to describe magazines, crimes, and television programs.  That meaning also applies when talking about serial data:  “serial communication” means that all information between two entities is being sent one piece at a time, following in a single stream.  One piece of data, or one bit, is just a binary piece of information: you’re either sending a 0 or a 1.  In Arduino terminology (and, derivatively, openFrameworks terminology), these are frequently referred to as “high” and “low”; 0 is low (like turning a light off) and 1 is high (flipping it back on).  8 bits (for example the stream 01000001, which represents the letter A) are sometimes packaged together to create a single byte.</p>
<p>Arduino has a built-in library which handles most of the back-end processes for reading and writing to a Serial port. </p>
<p><strong>note: expand on Serial library</strong></p>
<p>The speed at which data is transmitted between the Arduino and your software is measured in bits per second, or bps, a fairly self-explanatory unit of measurement.  The rate of bits per second is commonly referred to as the baud rate, and will vary based on your application.  For example, the standard baud rate of 9600bps will transfer data more slowly than a rate of 115200, but the faster baud rate may have more issues with byte scrambling.</p>
<h2 id="digital-and-analog-communication">digital and analog communication</h2>
<p><em>basic notes - flesh this section out more</em></p>
<p>Digital read / write - will also be binary (1 or 0) -- use a pushbutton</p>
<p>Analog read - ADC analog-digital converter chip on pins A0-A5; requires small delay because of electrical noise / jitter from the Atmega analog pin</p>
<p>use a photoresistor / light sensor - this will convert the resistance coming in to a value between 0 and 1KB, or 0 and 1023</p>
<p><strong>USING SERIAL MONITOR WITH ARDUINO</strong></p>
<p><em>basic notes - flesh this section out more</em></p>
<p>The Arduino IDE has a built-in Serial monitor, which enables you to "tune in" to the data coming across a serial port at a specified baud rate. </p>
<p>Serial.println("Hello world!");</p>
<p>Serial.println(incoming value)</p>
<p>Convert incoming value to an outgoing value</p>
<p>PWM (pulse width modulation) - on pwm pins</p>
<p>map()</p>
<h2 id="using-serial-for-communication-between-arduino-and-openframeworks">using serial for communication between arduino and openframeworks</h2>
<p>In the same way that Arduino uses Serial communication for communication between hardware and the Serial monitor, it can also use Serial communication to communicate between the Arduino board and any other running application, including openFrameworks.  This can be done quite simply using the ofSerial class, native to openFrameworks.  This class sets up a Serial listener at a specified baud rate and Serial port, giving it access to the same streaming data as the Serial library in the native Arduino IDE.<br />
</p>
<p>// code missing: ofSerial example</p>
<p><strong>USING FIRMATA AS A SERIAL PROTOCOL</strong></p>
<p>Though it’s possible to navigate all serial communication manually, you’ll reach the limitations of what you’re able to do fairly quickly - as soon as you start wanting to address different devices or have multiple inputs, you’ll fall into a spiral of packet management and be much more prone to getting corrupt packets or inaccurate and scrambled data.  Rather than deal with this manually, it’s much simpler to use Firmata, an open source protocol for managing multiple Serial streams.</p>
<p><strong>OFARDUINO</strong></p>
<p>ofArduino, the built-in Arduino communication class for openFrameworks, is based on Firmata protocol.  Using ofArduino assumes that a default Firmata sketch is loaded onto the Arduino.  This sketch, found in the Arduino examples folder, enables all of the pins of the Arduino for communication through both analog and digital communication, as well as more specific addressing of pins for servomotor control.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLE</strong>: Work through the same LED blink sketch as done previously with only Arduino, but with OF.</p>
<p>The basic flow of what we’re going to do looks like this: (graphic missing)</p>
<ul>
<li>Make an ofArduino object</li>
<li>Connect to the Arduino object at the correct port and baud rate</li>
<li>Set up an event listener to determine whether we’re successfully connected to the Arduino</li>
<li>Set up a pin to communicate with, and specify whether that communication is analog or digital</li>
<li>Poll for data from the serial port</li>
<li>Send HIGH and LOW (or analog value) arguments to that pin</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Make an ofArduino object</strong></p>
<p>The first step is to add an ofArduino object into the header file of your project (usually, testApp.h).  I'll call this myArduino.</p>
<pre><code>void setup();
void update();
void draw();

ofArduino myArduino;
</code></pre>
<p>Now we've extended the capabilities of the native openFrameworks ofArduino class into our sketch, and we can work with the object myArduino.</p>
<p><strong>Connect to the Arduino object at the correct port and baud rate</strong></p>
<p>In the setup() of testApp.cpp, use the ofArduino <code>connect()</code> function to set up a connection at the appropriate port and baud rate.  <code>connect()</code> takes two parameters: the first is a String of the serial port name, which should match the serial port name you connected to in the Arduino application; the second is the baud rate.  Firmata uses a standard baud rate of 57600 bps.</p>
<pre><code>ard.connect("/dev/tty.usbserial-a700fiyD", 57600);
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Set up an event listener to determine whether we’ve successfully connected to the Arduino</strong></p>
<p>If you're working only within the Arduino IDE, it's easy to have functions (like setting up the pin modes) called only once at the start of the program -- you can just call those functions from within <code>setup()</code> with the confidence that they'll always be run once when the device initializes.   When you're communicating with other software like openFrameworks, however, it's important to have a checking system to ensure that any setup functions only occur after a connection has been established.  openFrameworks uses the ofEventUtils class to make this easier, relying on the default <code>ofAddListener()</code> and <code>ofRemoveListener()</code> functions to check for the connection event.</p>
<p>Within the openFrameworks app, we'll want to create an Arduino-specific <code>setup()</code> function, which is only called once as a result of the serial connection being established.  We'll declare this function first in testApp.h:</p>
<pre><code>void setupArduino(const int &amp; version);
</code></pre>
<p>... and call it from testApp.cpp:</p>
<pre><code>void testApp::setupArduino(const int &amp; version) {
    // Arduino setup tasks will go here
}
</code></pre>
<p>The argument that's being passed to the function, <code>const int &amp; version</code>, is a default return from the listener we're about to set up, which always responds to a connection event by sending back an argument with the connected firmware version.  That can stay as it is.</p>
<p>In the <code>setup()</code> of testApp.cpp, create a listener using <code>ofAddListener()</code>.  <code>ofAddListener()</code> is a function of ofEventUtils, which takes the arguments (event object, callback object, callback function).  When the event object happens (in this case, when the ofArduino EInitialized event is triggered), ofAddListener tells the callback object (here, a pointer to the testApp itself, referred to as “this”) to perform the setupArduino function that we created in the last step.</p>
<pre><code>ofAddListener(myArduino.EInitialized, this, &amp;testApp.setupArduino);
</code></pre>
<p>When the EInitialized event is triggered (when the connection to the Arduino is complete, and the Arduino responds by sending back information about its firmware version), the listener sends us to the callback function, which in this case is <code>setupArduino()</code>.</p>
<p>Within <code>setupArduino()</code>, we can remove the listener, because we know a connection has been established.  <code>ofRemoveListener()</code> takes the same arguments as its counterpart.</p>
<pre><code>ofRemoveListener(myArduino.EInitialized, this, &amp;testApp.setupArduino);
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Set up a pin to communicate with, and specify whether that communication is analog or digital</strong></p>
<p>Now it's time to treat our Arduino setup function just like we would within a standard Arduino app, and set up our pins and pin modes.  Here, I'm going to set up my Arduino Pin 13 as a digital output, in preparation for making a basic LED blink.</p>
<pre><code>myArduino.sendDigitalPinMode(13, ARD_OUTPUT);
</code></pre>
<p>The other options for pin setup follow in line with standard Arduino pin settings:</p>
<pre><code>sendDigitalPinMode(PIN_NUMBER, ARD_INPUT) // digital input
sendAnalogPinMode(PIN_NUMBER, ARD_OUTPUT) // analog output
sendAnalogPinMode(PIN_NUMBER, ARD_INPUT) // analog input
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Poll for data from the serial port</strong></p>
<p>In order to continuously update with new information on the serial port, it's important to periodically call the ofArduino <code>update()</code> function.  This can be done in its own Arduino-specific function, or can be called directly from <code>testApp::update()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>myArduino.update();
</code></pre>
<p>That's it! Now you're ready to start sending digital signals to pin 13 on your Arduino. </p>
<p>There are any number of triggers that you can use to control this signalling: you could set up a timer, integrate it into a game event, use a camera input... the possibilities are endless!  Here, I'm going to trigger my Pin 13 LED to turn on and off based on the up and down arrow keys.</p>
<p>Because I'm controlling activity with keyboard keys, I'm going to use the <code>void testApp::keyPressed (int key)</code> function, but you could also place your triggers within <code>draw()</code> or another function depending on your desired effect.</p>
<pre><code>void testApp::keyPressed  (int key){
    switch (key) {
        case OF_KEY_UP:
            ard.sendDigital(13, ARD_HIGH);  // turn LED on
            break;
        case OF_KEY_DOWN:
            ard.sendDigital(13, ARD_LOW); // turn LED off
            break;
        default:
            break;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>When all the parts are together, run the app and toggle your UP and DOWN arrow keys to turn the on-board LED on your Arduino on and off!  You can also put in a 3mm or 5mm LED on pin 13 to make the effect more obvious.  Remember that pin 13 is the only Arduino pin with a built-in resistor, so if you want to add LEDs or other components on other pins, you'll need to build a full circuit with resistors to avoid burning out your parts.</p>
