## Chapter: Introduction to version control with Git (Christoph Buchner)

*This chapter will give a high-level overview over a pretty complex topic with a generous amount of links to more material to enable readers to easily find appropriate information. It's quite difficult to do it in anything approaching completeness in only a couple of pages, and a high-level overview  will be more useful to the reader.*

### What is version control, and why should you use it?

* VCS versus manual methods (e.g. backups in named folders)
* Which problems are avoided?
* Enables management of larger projects and/or collaboration in teams
* Popular systems and their major differences

### Introduction to Git
* What is Git? 
* How does it work? 
    - *short crash-course with generous links to deeper reading*
    - *KISS! this will be the major challenge considering Git's complexity*
    - introduce following terms:
        - repositories
        - commits&immutability
        - branches
        - merging, merge conflicts(!)
        - gitignore
        - remotes, push&pull.
        - ...
* Most often used commands and features
* List of popular GUI clients

### Github
* What is it?
* How does it work? What can it do for you: Pull requests, issue trackers, collaboration
* openFrameworks on Github. 
* Your project(s) on Github

### Conclusion

* Where do you go from here? More complex & powerful VCS mechanisms out there (git flow, branching workflows,...)
* Where/how do you get help if things go wrong? (Stack Overflow, Git homepage, google, OF forum category "revision control")
* (more tools?)
